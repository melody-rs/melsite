title: On a "better C"

 Quite often when I was working on transbian-god-conquerer (The working title for the unfinished 2024 Yuri jam submission) I found myself wishing for a better C.
 That project was written from the ground up in C- simply because it's what me and my other friend working on it were familiar with and happy to program in.
 We probably should've used C++. Maybe. But my mind kept jumping back to what it'd take to make C more enjoyable to work with

Quite often when I was working on transbian-god-conquerer (The working title for the unfinished 2024 Yuri jam submission) I found myself wishing for a better C.
That project was written from the ground up in C- simply because it's what me and my other friend working on it were familiar with and happy to program in.
We probably should've used C++. Maybe. But my mind kept jumping back to what it'd take to make C more enjoyable to work with

And any ideas I had for a better C literally turned C into Rust. Every time.

Was it because I use Rust a lot? Probably?
But it's crazy to me that logically following through how to fix C's major problems would turn the language into Rust, albeit a really scuffed version of Rust

# Void pointers & Generics

So. 

# Method calls

# Function pointers/Interfaces
